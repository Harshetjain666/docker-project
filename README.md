 I create a project with the help of docker. We use a docker owncloud image and my SQL image for databse.
If you want to use this so please first you download the docker images
1) owncloud
2) mysql:5.7

And also you need to download docker- compose software from internet after that you just create a new file with name docker-compose.yml and copy and paste it inside this file our code and then use it
With open docker-compose up cmd.
